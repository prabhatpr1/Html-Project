        <h1>The Perfect Crispy Samosa Recipe</h1>
        <p>This recipe yields approximately 10-12 medium-sized samosas.</p>
        <h3>1. Samosa Dough (Patti)</h3>
        <p>The secret to a flaky crust is using enough fat (ghee/oil) and kneading a stiff dough.</p>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Combine Dry Ingredients:</b>In a large bowl, mix the flour, salt, and carom seeds (if using).</li>
            <li><b>Rub in the Fat (Moyan):</b>Add the melted ghee or oil. Use your fingertips to rub the fat into the flour. Rub thoroughly for 3-4 minutes until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Test the mixture by pressing a handful—it should hold its shape.</li>
            <li><b>Knead the Dough:</b>Add cold water, one tablespoon at a time. Mix until the dough comes together. Do NOT over-knead. The dough must be stiff and firm (unlike roti or chapati dough, which is soft). It should feel slightly rough and not smooth.</li>
            <li><b>Rest:</b>Cover the dough with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 30-45 minutes at room temperature. This is crucial for flakiness.</li>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare Potatoes: Boil the potatoes until cooked through, but not mushy. Peel them, then roughly mash or cube them. You want texture, not a smooth paste</li>
            <li>Sauté Spices: Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and let them splutter. Add the chopped ginger and green chilies; sauté for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add Peas & Dry Spices: Add the green peas (thaw first if frozen) and cook for 1 minute. Add the coriander powder, garam masala, and red chili powder. Cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Combine Filling: Add the potatoes and salt. Mix gently but thoroughly, making sure the spices coat the potatoes. Stir in the dry mango powder (Amchur) and fresh coriander leaves.</li>
            <li>Cool: Transfer the filling to a plate and let it cool completely before assembling the samosas.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>3. Shaping and Frying</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Roll the Dough: Give the rested dough a quick knead. Divide it into 5-6 equal portions. Roll each portion into a smooth ball.</li>
            <li>Cut the Disc: Roll the ball into an oval or circle about 6 inches long and medium-thin (about 2mm thickness). Cut the oval into two semi-circles using a knife.</li>
            <li>Form the Cone: Take one semi-circle. Wet the straight edge lightly with water. Take the two corners of the straight edge and bring them together, overlapping them slightly, to form a cone. Press the seam firmly to seal the cone.</li>
            <li>Fill and Seal: Hold the cone open. Fill it about three-quarters full with the cooled potato filling (approx. 1.5 - 2 tablespoons).</li>
            <li>Pinch and Seal: Wet the remaining open edges of the cone. Gently pinch a pleat/fold on one side of the seam near the sealed point. Press the open edges together firmly to create the final triangle shape.</li>
            <li>Fry (The Crucial Step): Heat oil in a deep pot over low heat.24 The oil should be just warm, around $300^\circ\text{F}$ ($150^\circ\text{C}$).</li>
            <li>Fry on Low: Carefully drop the samosas into the warm oil (do not overcrowd). Maintain low heat. Fry for 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally. The low heat allows the crust to cook through and become flaky without burning.</li>
            <li>Finish: Once the samosas are golden brown and crispy, remove them, drain excess oil on paper towels, and serve hot with mint chutney or tamarind chutney.</li>
        </ol>
